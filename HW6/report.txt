Please answer time/space complexities for each problem in report.txt.

[UPDATE]
0. For each of the coding problems below:
   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-one one faster?
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists)
