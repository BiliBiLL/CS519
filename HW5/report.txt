0. Compare two recursive implementations of fib (naive vs. memoized).
   (a) What's exact complexity of naive in theory?
	T(n) = T(n-1)+T(n-2)+O(1), approxiamately O(2^n)
   (b) Let's say you know it's O(a^n); can you curve-fit to determine the approximate value of a?
	function f(x)=a*x+b (f(x) is log(y))
   (c) Does this value match the theoretical complexity?
	Yes
1. [WILL BE GRADED]
   Maximum Weighted Independent Set 

   Q: What's the complexity?
   A: O(n)

2. Number of n-node BSTs
   What's the complexity of this DP?
   O(n^2)
   What's the name of this famous number series?
   Catalan number

1. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this assignment?
4-5 hours per days
2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?
difficult
3. Did you work on it mostly alone, or mostly with other people?
alone
4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%–100%)?
70% 
5. Which part(s) of the course you like the most so far?
6. Which part(s) of the course you dislike the most so far?
I think we need more time for class, there are too many content but limit time to get details about 
how to implement it, Or a little bit more time for office hour
